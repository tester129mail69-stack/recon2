## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in GODRECON, please **do not** open a public GitHub issue.
Instead, use one of the following responsible disclosure channels:

1. **GitHub Private Security Advisory** (preferred):
   Navigate to the [Security tab](https://github.com/tester129mail69-stack/recon2/security/advisories/new)
   of this repository and open a private advisory.

2. **Email**: Contact the maintainers privately. Include as much detail as possible:
   - A description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce.
   - Potential impact.
   - Any suggested mitigations (if available).

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

- Allow a reasonable time (up to 90 days) for the maintainers to investigate and release a fix before
  making any information public.
- Do not exploit the vulnerability beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.
- Do not access or modify data that does not belong to you while researching the issue.
- Act in good faith and follow coordinated disclosure practices.

We appreciate responsible security research and will acknowledge contributors in release notes
(unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
